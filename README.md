# Streaming Availability App-Project 1

## Description

It’s date night with your significant other… you’ve ordered takeout and you want to sit down and watch that classic movie or show that both of you enjoy. But based on constantly changing copyright agreements between the major streaming platforms, you are both unsure as to where you can stream the show. How convenient it would be for a website to quickly and easily show you what platforms you can stream any show on. 
“Dude, where’s my show?”, provides this service and more! Not only will you be able to search for your show of choice, but you can quickly obtain different helpful details about the show as well, including run time, year of release, and what platforms the show is available to stream on. You can also watch the related trailer for that show directly from the website, and even favorite shows that you regularly watch or want to come back to. 
Additionally, there is an advanced search feature,  if you’re wanting to filter down to a specific country of origin, differentiate between a movie or a series, or denote the language the show is played in. 

Dude, where's my show should definitely be a favorite website of you and your friends!

Features of this page include the users ability to search for and load streaming availability results for particular movies and shows. An advanced search modal pop up when the advanced search button is clicked, allowing for the user to filter their search even further. Ability for users to intuitively see their search history, and re-append data to the page without hitting the API continuously (this is done through the use of accessing locally stored data), as well as adding movies and shows to a favorites section. A YouTube trailer button, and the further detail page which can be accessed by clicking on the movie poster image on the main page. Within our nav bar their is a link to an about us page, where users can access links to each developers GitHub account.
