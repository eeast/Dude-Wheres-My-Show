# Streaming Availability App-Project 1

## Description

It’s date night with your significant other… you’ve ordered takeout and you want to sit down and watch that classic movie or show that both of you enjoy. But based on constantly changing copyright agreements between the major streaming platforms, you are both unsure as to where you can stream the show. How convenient it would be for a website to quickly and easily show you what platforms you can stream any show on. 
“Dude, where’s my show?”, provides this service and more! Not only will you be able to search for your show of choice, but you can quickly obtain different helpful details about the show as well, including run time, year of release, and what platforms the show is available to stream on. You can also watch the related trailer for that show directly from the website, and even favorite shows that you regularly watch or want to come back to. 
Additionally, there is an advanced search feature,  if you’re wanting to filter down to a specific country of origin, differentiate between a movie or a series, or denote the language the show is played in. 

Dude, where's my show should definitely be a favorite website of you and your friends!
